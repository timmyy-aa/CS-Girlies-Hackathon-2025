Making Learning Fun Again with Buddy

Buddy – Web App Overview

Have you ever wanted to overcome procrastination and study more efficiently?
Buddy is designed exactly for that. It helps college students stay productive by combining goal-setting, social accountability, friendly competition, and structured study tools.

With Buddy, you and your friends can connect, create SMART goals, set deadlines, track each other’s progress, and remind one another to stay on track. Instead of studying alone and falling behind, Buddy turns productivity into a shared experience.

How Buddy Works
1. Set SMART Goals + Deadlines

Users add schoolwork or study tasks they need to complete, along with clear timelines and progress checkpoints.

2. Connect With Friends

Buddy allows individuals or groups to study together, track one another’s progress, and offer support.

3. Gamified Wagers & Rewards

To make things fun, each task can include:

A reward if you finish on time

A wager set by your friends if you don’t

Example:
If you have a midterm coming up, you create “Study for Midterm” as a task, set a deadline, and choose a reward. Your friend can add a small consequence if you miss it — turning productivity into a playful challenge rather than something stressful.

4. Study Space + Timer

Buddy includes a built-in Pomodoro timer, a progress tracker, and a clean study workspace so you can work efficiently.

5. Upload Proof of Study

You can upload pictures of your notes, screenshots, or digital work to show progress and stay accountable.

6. Optional Recap Calls

After studying, you can hop on a quick call with your friend to explain what you learned — reinforcing knowledge through peer teaching.

Summary

Buddy transforms studying from a lonely, procrastination-prone activity into a social, gamified, and motivating experience. By combining accountability, SMART goals, progress tracking, and friendly wagers, Buddy helps students stay consistent and enjoy learning with their peers.

You’re turning productivity into a team game — encouraging good habits through fun, support, and collaboration.

What Went Into the Creation of Buddy

The creation of Buddy involved a combination of user-focused design, intentional problem-solving, and modern development tools. I built it specifically for college students to help curb procrastination and encourage mutual support.

The entire user interface was first designed in Figma, where I focused on simple layouts, intuitive navigation, and features tailored to student workflows. After finalizing the design, I implemented the application using code written and refined with the help of large language models such as Claude and ChatGPT. This allowed me to quickly prototype features, iterate on ideas, and bring the full concept to life efficiently.

Overall, Buddy blends thoughtful UI/UX design with AI-assisted development to create a practical, motivating, and supportive productivity tool for students.
